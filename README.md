## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. To create an interactive mobile application for adopters and shelters to perform pet adoptions procedures.
2. To generate an analytical report for shelters to track their adoption rates and engagements on the application.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack
Below is the high-level overview of the tech stack Fido uses:

- This project uses the [React Native app development framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native is a Javascript framework created by Facebook to develop both Android and iOS mobile applications, built on Facebook's previous library, React.
- For synchronized real-time database, the app uses the [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/), a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that allows data to be stored and synced  between users in realtime.
- To send push notifications, the app uses [One Signal services](https://onesignal.com/), a free customer engagement solution for Push Notifications, Email, SMS & In-App.
- The app uses the font ["Roboto"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as its main font.
